# chrome-extension-hn-filter

HN's gotten markedly more political in recent months. There are plenty of places to finger-argue on the net, so I made this extension that allows you to create a list of keywords and links with those keywords in the title are removed before you see them.

Instructions:

1. When you're on HN, you'll see the little YCombinator logo enable. 
2. Click it and create a comma-separated list of words. 

Those words are used to filter out unwanted stories. The filtration happens on page load and when the list is changed.

This is 2 hours worth of work, so it's not exactly a masterpiece. Feel free to fork or contribute.
